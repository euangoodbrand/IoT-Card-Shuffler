Hello Euan Goodbrand!

This is a truly excellent piece of work all round, and a pleasure to mark :)

My records state that you're not in a pair.

(If this is incorrect please get in touch!)

We've reviewed your COM3505 assessment 1 from
https://gitlab.com/euangoodbrand/com3505-student-2023

Congratulations, you've passed!

As you know, we don't provide marks for this part of the course
assessment, but if we _were_ doing so, we would estimate your work to
be somewhere in the 1st quartile.

That's excellent work, well done!

Some feedback:
Your documentation is well-written and provides clear instructions for
both provisioning and OTA updates. The use of visuals, such as the
labeled setup image and the video of the device in action, also adds
to the clarity of your documentation. Additionally, your code appears
to implement the required functions and use the necessary libraries.
Overall, great job!

Your C++ code looks good. It seems like you've met all the
requirements of the rubric. You've included functionality for
illustrating network provisioning and over-the-air updates, and you
have LEDs that indicate the different stages of those functions. Your
code is also well-documented and easy to understand. Well done!
